# klartext

A native-Rust BMW diagnostic & coding tool for F-series cars (target: a 2014 F20), speaking
UDS over the BMW-proprietary **HSFZ** transport across an ENET (Ethernet) cable.

> **Milestones 1–3 (done):** HSFZ transport bring-up, diagnostics (read DTCs / DIDs, clear
> faults, gateway discovery), and the **semantic layer** that turns raw results into meaning
> from the user's own ISTA data. Replay-coding is a later milestone.

## Status

- ✅ HSFZ framing (encode/decode) — implemented from `docs/protocol-reference.md`
- ✅ Async TCP connection — connect + `TCP_NODELAY`, segment reassembly, ack-skip, bounded NRC-0x78 retry
- ✅ UDS reads/clears — TesterPresent, DiagnosticSessionControl, ReadDTCInformation, ReadDataByIdentifier, ClearDiagnosticInformation
- ✅ CLI — gateway discovery, `read-faults`, `read-did`, `clear-faults` (gated by `--confirm`), `tester-present`
- ✅ Semantic layer (M3) — DB-backed fault text + ISO 14229 status flags; ISO-standard DID names; sourced from the user's ISTA SQLiteDB
- ⏳ End-to-end test against a real F20 — **your step** (see *Manual hardware test*)

HSFZ is reverse-engineered from the report; **no packet capture and no ISTA data are committed**
(BYO-data — they contain the VIN / are BMW-proprietary). Several wire values remain unverified, so
the CLI prints them as a checklist to confirm against your car (see *Verify against a capture*).

## Layout (Cargo workspace)

| Dir | Package | Role |
|---|---|---|
| `crates/uds` | `klartext-uds` | Pure UDS (ISO 14229) message encode/decode. No transport, no async. |
| `crates/hsfz` | `klartext-hsfz` | The concrete HSFZ transport: frame codec + async connection. |
| `crates/client` | `klartext-client` | Managed UDS session + typed read/clear services over HSFZ. |
| `crates/semantic` | `klartext-semantic` | Meaning: raw DTC/DID → human text + scaled values, via the ISTA SQLiteDB and the SGBD `SG_FUNKTIONEN` table (read-only). |
| `crates/sgbd` | `klartext-sgbd` | EDIABAS SGBD (`.prg`) container parser: XOR-`0xF7` body + tables; feeds proprietary measurement scaling. |
| `cli` | `klartext-cli` | The `klartext` binary; composes the crates above. |
| `mcp` | `klartext-mcp` | MCP server over stdio: reads + the confirmation-gated `clear_faults`; no actuation, ever (reuses client + semantic). |

Future sibling: `klartext-doip`. There is deliberately **no `Transport` trait**
yet — one transport exists today; a trait gets extracted when DoIP is added.

## Build & test

```sh
cargo build --workspace
cargo test --workspace                               # unit tests (report byte vectors, DB lookups on synthetic fixtures)
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings
cargo fmt --all
```

## Semantic database (BYO-data, one-time)

The semantic layer reads a compact SQLite extracted from **your own** ISTA `DiagDocDb`. ISTA ships
that database encrypted; `scripts/build-semantic-db.sh` decrypts it locally and extracts only the
tables klartext needs into `data/klartext-semantic.db` (gitignored — never committed or embedded):

```sh
scripts/build-semantic-db.sh /path/to/ISTA/SQLiteDBs/DiagDocDb.sqlite
# or, with the default path data/Testmodule(1)/SQLiteDBs/DiagDocDb.sqlite:
scripts/build-semantic-db.sh
```

It builds [SQLite3 Multiple Ciphers](https://github.com/utelle/SQLite3MultipleCiphers) from a
pinned, checksum-verified amalgamation (only a C compiler is needed). The cipher/password were
recovered from your ISTA install — see `docs/sqlite-findings.md`. Without this DB, reads still work
and fall back to raw codes.

## Usage

Find the gateway (BMW gateways usually sit on an unconfigured link-local `169.254.x.x` address):

```sh
klartext discover                 # broadcasts 00 00 00 00 00 11 on UDP 6811, dumps replies + source IP
```

Reads auto-discover and connect (or pass `--gateway-ip`); `--target <hex>` selects the ECU:

```sh
klartext --target 12 read-faults          # decoded fault text + ISO status flags for the DME (0x12)
klartext --target 12 read-faults --raw    # ...and the raw 3-byte code / status byte
klartext read-did F190                     # ReadDataByIdentifier 0xF190 → "VIN": decoded value
klartext read-did 172A --raw               # ...also the underlying bytes
klartext --target 12 clear-faults --confirm   # state change — refuses without --confirm
```

Key flags: `--target <hex>` (default `10` = ZGW), `--semantic-db <path>` (default
`data/klartext-semantic.db`, env `KLARTEXT_SEMANTIC_DB`), `--gateway-ip`, `--raw`, `--port`,
`--timeout`, `--connect-timeout`. See `klartext --help`.

### What the semantic layer decodes

- **`read-faults`** — the raw 3-byte DTC is mapped to ISTA's fault text per ECU variant, and the
  status byte is decoded into ISO 14229 flags (`testFailed`, `confirmedDTC`, `pendingDTC`, …).
- **`read-did`** — the ISO-standard identification DIDs (0xF1xx, e.g. VIN) are named from the
  report; values render as text when printable. **BMW-specific DID scaling is _not_ in the
  SQLiteDB** — it lives in the EDIABAS SGBD — so arbitrary live-data DIDs show name (if standard)
  plus the raw value. Full physical scaling is deferred to the SGBD path. See `docs/sqlite-findings.md`.

## Manual hardware test (your step)

We can't reach the car — the unit tests only cover framing/decoding against known vectors and
synthetic DB fixtures, and we never claim a hardware round-trip works. To validate end-to-end:

1. Connect the ENET cable; give your NIC a link-local `169.254.x.x` address; wake the car (terminal 15).
2. `klartext discover` → note the responder's IP (that's your gateway).
3. `klartext --target 12 read-faults` → expect decoded fault descriptions for the DME.
4. Capture the session in Wireshark and confirm the values in *Verify against a capture* — in
   particular the raw-3-byte-DTC → ISTA code mapping the semantic layer relies on.

## Verify against a capture

These reverse-engineered values are printed by the CLI after every real run. Confirm them with
Wireshark (it has HSFZ/DoIP dissectors) on the ENET link (report Part 6):

1. **HSFZ LENGTH semantics** — counts `SRC+TGT+UDS` (= `2 + len(UDS)`), excluding the 6-byte
   length+control header. *Highest priority:* the report self-contradicts; resolved via Scapy and
   the `00 00 00 00 00 11` discovery datagram (LENGTH=0 with a control word present).
2. Diagnostic port **TCP 6801**, control/ident port **UDP 6811** — ICOM setups reassign these.
3. Tester address **0xF4**, ZGW/gateway **0x10** — scan targets to see which answer.
4. Connect timeout **5000 ms** (ediabaslib) vs **20000 ms** (EDIABAS.INI) — set via `--connect-timeout`.
5. **P2 = 50 ms / P2\* = 5000 ms** — ISO defaults; the F20 reports its own in the `10 03` response.
6. Control words **0x01/0x02/0x11/0x12** — corroborated but proprietary.
7. **0x11 identification-string layout** — unparsed in M1; `klartext discover` dumps it raw to capture.
8. **Alive-check (0x12)** direction/interval, and whether `3E 80` alone holds the session — later milestone.
9. **DTC numbering** — that the raw 3-byte DTC equals ISTA's `XEP_FAULTCODES.CODE` (24-bit) the
   semantic layer keys on, and the `59 02` record framing.

## Safety

Reads (DTCs, DIDs, identifiers) are safe and run autonomously. State changes — `clear-faults` —
require explicit `--confirm`. No actuation, no coding writes, no flashing yet; when added, writes
will require confirmation and read-back of the original bytes. The semantic layer is strictly
read-only: it opens the SQLiteDB read-only and never reaches the network or the car.
